Status

    Draft

Version

    Version 1, 2023-06-13

Number

    EGL Extension #150

Extension Type

    EGL client extension

Dependencies

    Requires EGL_EXT_client_extensions to query its existence without
    a display.

    Requires EGL_EXT_platform_base.

    This extension is written against the wording of version 7 of the
    EGL_EXT_platform_base specification.

Overview

    This extension defines how to create EGL resources from native qnx
    resources using the functions defined by EGL_EXT_platform_base.

New Types

    None

New Procedures and Functions

    None

New Tokens

    Accepted as the <platform> argument of eglGetPlatformDisplayEXT:

        EGL_PLATFORM_QNX                0x3550

Additions to the EGL Specification

    None.

New Behavior

    To determine if the EGL implementation supports this extension, clients
    should query the EGL_EXTENSIONS string of EGL_NO_DISPLAY.

    To obtain an EGLDisplay backed by a qnx display, call
    eglGetPlatformDisplayEXT with <platform> set to EGL_PLATFORM_QNX.  The
    <native_display> parameter specifies the qnx display. The <native_display> must
    be a screen_display_t or be EGL_DEFAULT_DISPLAY. If
    <native_display> is EGL_DEFAULT_DISPLAY, then EGL will create a new
    screen_display_t structure by connecting to the default qnx display.

    To obtain an on-screen rendering surface from a qnx window, call
    eglCreatePlatformWindowSurfaceEXT with a <dpy> that belongs to qnx and
    a <native_window> that points to a QNX screen_surface_t.
