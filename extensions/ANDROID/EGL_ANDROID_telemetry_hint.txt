Number

    EGL Extension #153

Dependencies:

    None.

Overview

    The telemetry of Android OpenGL ES can be enhanced by including information
    about the purpose for which a context is created. This extension introduces
    a new EGLConfig attribute that indicates the intended use of the context.
    By doing so, OpenGL telemetry can be separated based on which library
    created the context.

    This extension is specifically designed for use by Android Platform
    developers. Consequently, we have not defined the values associated with
    EGL_ANDROID_TELEMETRY_HINT within this specification. Instead, these values
    are defined in Android's telemetry header files, allowing us to easily add
    new telemetry hints without cluttering this specification.

New Types

    None.

New Procedures and Functions

    None.

New Tokens

    Accepted by the <attrib_list> parameter of eglCreateContext:

    EGL_ANDROID_TELEMETRY_HINT                      0x9001

Issues

    None.
