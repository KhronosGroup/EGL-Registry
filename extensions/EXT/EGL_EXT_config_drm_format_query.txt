Status

Version

    Version 1 - July 5th, 2022

Number

    EGL Extension #149

Extension Type

    EGL client extension

Dependencies

    Written based on the wording of the EGL 1.5 specification.

    This extension inlcudes the enum EGL_LINUX_DRM_FOURCC_EXT as defined in
    EGL_EXT_image_dma_buf_import and requires the EGL_KHR_stream extension.

Overview

    This extension adds an EGLConfig attribute for stream surface
    configurations that specifies a DRM format, as defined in drm_fourcc.h. If
    an application needs to share buffers with other libraries or processes
    that require specific formats, then this allows an application to select a
    matching EGLConfig accordingly.  EGLStream applications may need to know
    what DRM format a surface is using so that they can pass the format and any
    modifiers to other APIs or other stream consumers.

    This extension allows passing EGL_LINUX_DRM_FOURCC_EXT to
    eglGetConfigAttrib, allowing the application to forward the format code
    as needed. This is only valid on EGLConfigs which have the EGL_STREAM_BIT_KHR
    appear in the EGL_SURFACE_TYPE attribute.

New Types

    None

New Functions

    None

New Tokens

    Accepted as an attribute in the <attribute> parameter of
    eglGetConfigAttrib:

    EGL_LINUX_DRM_FOURCC_EXT                        0x3271

Changes in section 3.4.3 "Querying Configuration Attributes"

    Add EGL_LINUX_DRM_FOURCC_EXT to the attributes accepted by
    eglGetConfigAttrib. EGL_LINUX_DRM_FOURCC_EXT specifices a DRM format code
    as declared in the Linux drm_fourcc.h header. This is only valid on
    EGLConfigs which have the EGL_STREAM_BIT_KHR appear in the EGL_SURFACE_TYPE
    attribute.

    If EGL_LINUX_DRM_FOURCC_EXT is the attribute being requested and the
    EGLConfig does not have a corresponding DRM format, then DRM_FORMAT_INVALID
    is returned.

Changes in section 3.4.1 "Querying Configurations"

    If EGL_LINUX_DRM_FOURCC_EXT is specified as an attribute in the attrib_list
    argument of eglChooseConfig, then it will be ignored when choosing a
    config.

Issues

    1. Should EGL_LINUX_DRM_FOURCC_EXT be usable as an attribute in eglChooseConfig?

    RESOLVED: No, eglChooseConfig should ignore EGL_LINUX_DRM_FOURCC_EXT. We can't
    appropriately handle EGL_DONT_CARE due to possible collisions with DRM format
    values. Currently there is no DRM format that aliases with EGL_DONT_CARE, but
    there is no guarantee that it cannot happen in the future.

    2. Should this be limited to stream surface configs?

    RESOLVED: Yes, considering the only use case for this right now is interactions
    with EGLStream applications it doesn't make sense to support it in all cases
    and open the door to unintended consequences. If more use cases for this
    query operation appear then this restriction can be lifted.
