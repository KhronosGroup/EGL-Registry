Version

    Version 2, 2017-08-08

Number

    EGL Extension #122

Extension Type

    EGL device extension

Dependencies

    Requires EGL_EXT_platform_base and EGL_EXT_device_base.

    EGL_EXT_platform_device trivially interacts with this extension.

    This extension is written against the EGL 1.5 Specification.

Overview

    A system may support multiple devices and multiple window systems. For
    example, a Wayland environment may drive multiple GPUs and support both
    X11 and EGL clients. In order to realize this, the implementation must
    allow the client to specify both device and platform explicitly.

    The EGL_EXT_platform_device extension enables the client to create a
    display from a device, but does so by overloading the native_display
    argument to eglGetPlatformDisplay; the user passes the device as the
    native display, and presumably the EGL picks a sensible default for the
    window system.

    EGL_EXT_explicit_device differs by passing the device as an attribute
    to eglGetPlatformDisplay. This allows the client to name both the device
    and the platform.

New Behavior

    If EGL_DEVICE_EXT is specified as an attribute for eglGetPlatformDisplay,
    the value of the attribute is interpreted as an EGLDeviceEXT as returned
    by eglQueryDevicesEXT. The platform will attempt to initialize using
    exactly the specified device. If the attribute does not name a known
    EGLDeviceEXT, EGL_BAD_DEVICE_EXT is generated. If the device and platform
    are not compatible for any reason, EGL_BAD_MATCH is generated.

    If EGL_EXT_platform_device is supported, passing EGL_DEVICE_EXT as an
    attribute to eglGetPlatformDisplay(EGL_PLATFORM_DEVICE_EXT) generates
    EGL_BAD_ATTRIBUTE.
