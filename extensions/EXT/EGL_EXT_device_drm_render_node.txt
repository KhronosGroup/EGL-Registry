Status

    Draft

Version

    Version 1 - June 4th, 2021

Number

    EGL Extension #144

Extension Type

    EGL device extension

Dependencies

    Written based on the wording of the EGL 1.5 specification.

    EGL_EXT_device_query is required.

    EGL_EXT_device_drm interacts with this extension.

Overview

    The EGL_EXT_device_drm extension provided a method for applications
    to query the primary DRM device node file associated with a given
    EGLDeviceEXT object, but many cards also or exclusively have an
    associated render node DRM device node. This extension enables
    querying the render node file path of an EGLDeviceEXT object.

New Types

    None

New Procedures and Functions

    None

New Tokens

    Accepted as the <name> parameter of eglQueryDeviceStringEXT

        EGL_DRM_RENDER_NODE_FILE_EXT            0x3377

Changes to section 3.2 (Devices)

    Add the following paragraph to the description of
    eglQueryDeviceStringEXT:

    "To obtain a DRM device file for the render node associated with an
    EGLDeviceEXT, call eglQueryDeviceStringEXT with <name> set to
    EGL_DRM_RENDER_NODE_FILE_EXT. The function will return a pointer to
    a string containing the name of the device file (e.g.
    "/dev/dri/renderDN")."

    If EGL_EXT_device_drm is present, modify the the first sentence of
    the paragraph in the same section describing EGL_DRM_DEVICE_FILE_EXT
    to read:

    "To obtain a DRM device file for the primary node associated with an
    EGLDeviceEXT, call eglQueryDeviceStringEXT with <name> set to
    EGL_DRM_DEVICE_FILE_EXT."

Issues

    None.
