Status

    Complete.
    Approved by the EGL Working Group on January 31, 2014.
    Ratified by the Khronos Board of Promoters on March 14, 2014. 

Version

    Version 4, 2024/09/09

Number

    EGL Extension #70

Extension Type

    EGL client extension

Dependencies

    EGL 1.5 is required.

    This extension is written against the EGL 1.5 Specification (draft
    20140122).

    The behavior of part of this extension is different depending on whether
    the EGL_EXT_buffer_age and KHR_swap_buffers_with_damage extensions are also
    present.

Overview

    This extension defines how to create EGL resources from native Wayland
    resources using the EGL 1.5 platform functionality.

New Types

    None

New Procedures and Functions

    None

New Tokens

    Accepted as the <platform> argument of eglGetPlatformDisplay:

        EGL_PLATFORM_WAYLAND_KHR                0x31D8

Additions to the EGL Specification

    None.

New Behavior

    To determine if the EGL implementation supports this extension, clients
    should query the EGL_EXTENSIONS string of EGL_NO_DISPLAY.

    To obtain an EGLDisplay backed by a Wayland display, call
    eglGetPlatformDisplay with <platform> set to EGL_PLATFORM_WAYLAND_KHR.  The
    <native_display> parameter specifies the Wayland display  to use and must
    either point to a `struct wl_display` or be EGL_DEFAULT_DISPLAY. If
    <native_display> is EGL_DEFAULT_DISPLAY, then EGL will create a new
    wl_display structure by connecting to the default Wayland socket.  The
    manual page wl_display_connect(3) defines the location of the default
    Wayland socket.

    To obtain an on-screen rendering surface from a Wayland window, call
    eglCreatePlatformWindowSurface with a <dpy> that belongs to Wayland and
    a <native_window> that points to a `struct wl_egl_surface`.

    It is not valid to call eglCreatePlatformPixmapSurface with a <dpy> that
    belongs to Wayland. Any such call fails and generates an
    EGL_BAD_PARAMETER error.

    Rendering to the obtained EGLSurface or querying it with EGL_BUFFER_AGE_KHR
    will lock its back buffer preventing it from being dropped or resized,
    until the next buffer swap. The rationale behind this behavior is to keep
    operations result accurate until the next swap.

    Synchronously within the call to eglSwapBuffers the EGL implementation will
    invoke a series of requests on the associated wl_surface, including
    attaching the new front buffer, a full surface damage via wl_surface.damage
    or wl_surface.damage_buffer, and finally a wl_surface.commit.

    If the EGL implementation associated a wp_linux_drm_syncobj_surface_v1
    object with the surface, an acquire and a release point will be associated
    with the surface prior to the commit as well.

    If KHR_swap_buffers_with_damage is available, the equivalent to calling
    eglSwapBuffers will take place, with the exception that the damage
    according to <rects> and <n_rects> may be requested by the EGL
    implementation via wl_surface.damage_buffer, instead of requesting a full
    damage.

Issues

    1. Should this extension permit EGL_DEFAULT_DISPLAY as input to
       eglGetPlatformDisplay()?

       RESOLUTION: Yes. When given EGL_DEFAULT_DISPLAY, eglGetPlatformDisplay
       returns a display backed by the default Wayland display.

    2. Should this extension support creation of EGLPixmap resources from
       Wayland pixmaps?

       RESOLVED. No. Wayland has no pixmap type.

Revision History
    Version 4, 2024/09/09 (Jonas Ã…dahl)
        - Clarify wl_surface commit requirements.
        - Clarify wl_surface damage responsibilities.
        - Add dependency on KHR_swap_buffers_with_damage

    Version 3, 2022/07/14 (Kirill Chibisov)
        - Clarify EGLSurface back buffer locking behavior with regards to
          rendering and surface querying operations.
        - Add dependency on EGL_EXT_buffer_age.

    Version 2, 2014/02/18 (Chad Versace)
        - Change resolution of issue #1 from "no" to "yes". Now
          eglGetPlatformDisplay accepts EGL_DEFAULT_DISPLAY for Wayland.
        - Explain in more detail how EGL connects to the default Wayland
          display.

    Version 1, 2014/01/22 (Jon Leech)
        - Promote EGL_EXT_platform_wayland to KHR to go with EGL 1.5.
